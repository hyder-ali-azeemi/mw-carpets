# Handmade Pakistani Carpets

Handmade carpets from Pakistan carry a deep story. They're not just rugs – they’re built by hand, knot by knot, using skills passed down through generations. These carpets are crafted with care, using pure materials like wool and cotton. Whether you’re buying for your home or your collection, Pakistani carpets bring real value and meaning.

Pakistan is home to some of the world’s best carpet weaving regions. Each area adds its own look and feel to the designs. You’ll find bold patterns, rich colors, and soft textures that make these carpets stand out. Some designs are simple, while others are full of detail. No matter the style, they all have one thing in common – they’re made by hand, with care and time.

## Wool and Cotton Carpets

Most handmade carpets from Pakistan use natural materials. Wool is the most common – it’s warm, soft, and strong. A wool carpet is great for living rooms, bedrooms, and offices because it can handle daily use and still look good for years.

Cotton is also used, especially for the base of the carpet (called the warp and weft). Some carpets mix wool and cotton to get the benefits of both. These materials make the rug strong, flexible, and easier to shape into complex patterns.

## Knot Density: The Quality Behind Every Knot

Knot density is one of the most important things to look at in a handmade carpet. It tells you how many knots are tied per square inch. The higher the knot count, the finer the detail and the longer the carpet lasts. Some carpets have bold, open designs with lower knot density. Others, like fine Pak Persian rugs, have tight, detailed patterns that need a high number of knots.

Knot density affects how the carpet looks and feels. A carpet with higher knot density usually has sharper patterns and a smoother finish. It also takes more time and effort to make, which is why these rugs are often more valuable.
